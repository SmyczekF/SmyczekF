### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working in commissioning/dev company, further developing my IT skills and meeting fantastic people.
- 🌱 In my free time I help in developement of two websites from a friendly company (akademia-champion.pl, edukacja-alternatywna.pl[co - author])
- 📫 How to reach me: you can freely contact me on: https://www.linkedin.com/in/filip-smyczek-426577237.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that goosebumps are meant to ward off predators? :3
- 🤖 I want to dive into machine learning when I'll be ready.
- 🌍 I hope one day I'll be able to code something in every country all over the world.

Now my changes are commited to gitLab and private repositories, that is why my activity looks worse :)
